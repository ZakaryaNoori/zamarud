              Lapis Lazuli is a blue rock made of several different minerals
              including lazurite, sodalite, hauyne, calcite (which shows as
              white flecks), and pyrite (which adds a golden yellow sparkle).
              The composition and color of each stone varies, but it's the
              general intense dark blue color that is considered its best
              quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lapis lazuli has a uniform, massive appearance with distinct
              crystals, and can be semi opaque or opaque. Its color is of a
              strong, lively blue, sometimes with hint of violet. It often
              contains grayish or off-white patches or veins. The presence of
              these white patches reduces the value of the stone.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most highly prized lapis lazuli stones are uniformly colored
              and without a violet tinge. Lapis lazuli stones vary in hardness,
              ranging from a 5 to 5.5 on the hardness scale. The stone has
              vitreous luster. Lapis Lazuli is found as boulders within
              limestone. It has been mined in Afghanistan since remote
              antiquity. In fact, ancient Egyptians probably obtained their
              supplies from there. Argentina is also a source of lapis lazuli
              but Afghanistan is the best high quality stones mines.
